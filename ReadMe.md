**Java Data Structures**

- Arrays
    + Fixed in size
    + Fast for data retrivals
    + Compact memory usage if size is known
    + Delete operation very hard
  
- 2D Arrays

- Lists and ArrayList
    + Allow duplicates
    + Not fixed in size like arrays
    + Fast for data retrivals
    + Various Implementations
  
- Stack
  + The stack class represents LIFO stack of objects
  + Push = Adding new elements
  + Peek = It gives us the last element (LIFO)
  + Pop = It gives us the last element and delete it

- Queue
  + A collection designed for holding elements prior to processing
  + FIFO
  + Peek = It gives us the first element of queue
  + Poll = It gives us the first element and delete it
  
- Linked List

- Sets
  + No duplicates allowed
  + Set does not guarantee order
  + HashSet, MapSet
  
- Map Interface
  + A map can not contain duplicate keys
  + Each key can map to at most one value

- Hash Functions
